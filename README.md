# star-velocity-with-doppler
This MATLAB code calculates the velocity of a star based on the Doppler effect using spectrum information. It uses the given spectrum information, including the wavelengths and intensities, and the wavelength shift caused by the motion of the star to calculate the velocity. The code assumes that the speed of light is constant at 299,792,458 m/s.

The code is based on the scientific principle that the Doppler effect causes a shift in the wavelength of light emitted by a moving object. The shift in wavelength is proportional to the velocity of the object and can be used to calculate the object's velocity.

To use the code, you need to provide the spectrum information, including the wavelengths and intensities, and the wavelength shift caused by the motion of the star. The code then calculates the velocity of the star for each line in the spectrum.
